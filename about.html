          A thriving social change sector supported by film
        </h1>
        <p>
          Film for Change was co-founded in 2013 by Helen and Jesse, who saw a
          need for charities and community groups to have their stories told,
          and for filmmakers  to gain practical filmmaking experience while
          helping their communities. We make films, distribute them, run special
           interest film projects, and are involved in teaching, speaking, and
           consulting engagements. Everything we do is supported by our network
           of over 200 volunteers in the Wellington region, and in turn, we
           provide them with opportunities to practice their craft, gain
           experience in the industry, form long lasting relationships with
           like-minded people, and to make a socially positive impact on the
           world.<br />
           <br />
           We value creativity, collaboration, community, and education.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="subtitle">Creativity</h2>
        <p>
          Creativity is key when it comes to funding, making, and distributing
          short films. We believe in thinking outside of the box about problems,
          and strive to come up with engaging, creative solutions. We challenge
          our volunteers, our clients and ourselves to think creatively.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="subtitle">Collaboration</h3>
        <p>
          We work alongside our clients and come up with solutions together that
          we can all be proud of. We are not an advertising agency, and we are
          not a service for hire. We are a collective of collaborators who
          believe in the power of working together.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="subtitle">Community</h3>
        <p>
          Film for Change believes in the power of community. Naku te rourou nau
          te rourou ka ora ai te iwi. With your food basket and my food basket,
          the people can be cared for. We are part of the same charity/social
          enterprise community as our clients so we understand the challenges of
          the sector. We understand they are busy trying to do the things they
          are passionate about. We understand that time and money are precious
          resources. We are here to listen, and we are here to support.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="subtitle">Education</h3>
        <p>
          We have a culture of constant learning, skill sharing and adapting.
          We’re always learning and trying new things, and we encourage this
          kind of curiosity in our clients and in the volunteers we teach and
          learn from.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="subtitle">Teams</h2>
        <p>
          Film for change is made up of four teams; Finance, Comms, Relationships
          and Filmmaking. These four teams consist of over 200 volunteers in
          the Wellington region and our volunteers are a mix of experienced
          professionals to students.
